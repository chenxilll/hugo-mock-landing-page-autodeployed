This is [HW 2 Part II: Automating the Deployment of a Hugo Website](https://cis-3500.github.io/docs/example/homeworks/homework-2/#part-ii-automating-the-deployment-of-a-hugo-website-hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed) of CIS 3500 at UPenn.

MindHarbor is a cutting-edge mental wellness app that utilizes machine learning to provide personalized meditations, stress-relief routines, and exercises that fit effortlessly into your schedule. In addition to fostering personal wellness, MindHarbor cultivates a vibrant community where users can share experiences, find support, and connect with certified therapists.

Workflow **`.github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yaml`** checks out the repository, sets up the Hugo environment, compiles the static files, and publishes them to the `gh-pages` branch (asked Claude for help).

The [autodeployed landing page](https://chenxilll.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/) is published on GitHub Pages.
